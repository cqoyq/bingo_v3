--------------------------------- TCP Server test -----------------------------------------
1# server_t1.cpp
	Test that the client connect success, and accept_success_func() in server return -1,
	the server disconnect.
	
2# server_t2.cpp
	Test that the client connect success, and the client disconnect.
	
3# server_t3.cpp
	Test that the client connect success, the server disconnect after 15 seconds.
	
4# server_t4.cpp
	Test that the client connect success, and then send message to server. the server find that the
	message's header is wrong, and to disconnect.
	
5# server_t5.cpp
	Test that the client connect success, and then send message to server. the server receive full message, 
	to find that message is wrong, and to disconnect.
	
6# server_t6.cpp

	interval 20ms.
	
9# server_t9.cpp
	Test that the client connect to server. the server will authenticate client, invalid to disconnect.
	
10# server_t10.cpp
	Test that the client connect to server. the server will check heart-jump interval 3 seconds, if the 
	heart-jump is timeout, server will close socket.
	
11# server_t11.cpp
	Test that the client connect to server. the server will send actively heart-jump to client interval 3 seconds.
